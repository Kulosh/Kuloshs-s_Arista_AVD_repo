# Arista AVD

This Repo contains Examples from Arista and my own configuration for network with 2 spines and 4 leaves, with each 2 leaf switches being in a group in which is MLAG configured.

My configs are based on Arista's Single DC L3LS topology and configs, however, they are modified in some ways and for example the L2LEAF switches are completly missing as they are not important in this scenario...
